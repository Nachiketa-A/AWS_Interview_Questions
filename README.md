#### 1) What is the difference between stopping and terminating an instance?

**ANS :** When an Ec2 instance is stopped, a normal shutdown is performed on the instance.
          When an EC2 instance is terminated, it gets transferred to a stopped state, and then the attached EBS volumes are permanently deleted.
